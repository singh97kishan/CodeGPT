### ðŸš€ **Code GPT**: Generative AI Python Code Generator

A powerful AI-based solution that generates Python code based on user input prompts and allows you to execute it right in the UI.


### ðŸš€ Overview

Code GPT is a cutting-edge Generative AI tool that turns user prompts into functional Python programs instantly. What sets it apart? You can run the generated code right inside the app! Built on Langchain for smart prompt understanding, Mixtral from Groq for efficient AI computation, and powered by Python, this tool offers a smooth, all-in-one coding experience.


### ðŸŒŸ Unique Selling Point (USP)
Unlike other code generators, Code GPT lets you generate and run Python code directly in the UIâ€”no need for external tools or manual copying.


### âœ¨ Features

* **AI-Powered Code Generation:** Create Python code from natural language prompts.
* **Integrated Execution:** Run the generated code inside the Streamlit app.
* **Function Extraction:** Automatically extract and run Python functions using subprocess.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive, real-time interaction via Streamlit.


### ðŸ“‚ Tech Stack
